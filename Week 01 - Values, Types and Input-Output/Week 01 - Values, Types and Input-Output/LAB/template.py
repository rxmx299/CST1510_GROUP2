# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 1. Ask the user for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#
#    Remember: input() always gives back text.

dataset_name = input("Dataset name: ")     # : replace with an input() call
rows_loaded = float(input("Rows loaded: "))     # : replace with an input() call, converted
rows_expected = float(input("Rows expected: "))    # : replace with an input() call, converted


# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 2. Work out what you were NOT given.       [Typical and above]
#
#    - difference : how far the first is from the second
#    - percent    : the first as a percentage of the second
#
#    Do not type the answers. Calculate them.

difference = rows_loaded - rows_expected   # 
percent = (rows_loaded / rows_expected) * 100
# Useful because it shows what percentage of expected rows are still missing
missing_percentage = ((rows_expected - rows_loaded) / rows_expected ) * 100 


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 3. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : print the three values you were given, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : difference always shows its sign, plus one line of your own
#
#    Useful:   f"{value:>10.2f}"    right-aligned, 2 decimal places
#              f"{value:>+10.2f}"   the same, but always shows the sign

print()
print("=" * 34)
print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {dataset_name}")
print("=" * 34)

# : your report lines go here
print(f"  Rows Loaded  : {rows_loaded:>10.2f}")
print(f"  Rows Expected: {rows_expected:>10.2f}")
print(f"  Difference   : {difference:>+10.2f}")
print(f"  Percent      : {percent:>10.2f}%")
print(f"  Rows missing : {missing_percentage:>10.2f}%")

print("=" * 34)


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and write the error in your journal
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
#    [ ] Show it to the person next to you
